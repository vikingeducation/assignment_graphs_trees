[A Data Structures and Algorithms Ruby Assignment from the Viking Code School using Trees and Graphs](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

1) Matrix is much less efficient for memory usage, but much faster for reading weights
2) O(1) - new element in array, O(1) - change a value in an array, O(1) - attach to end of llist on array lookup
3) O(1) - new element in array, O(n) - iterate over existing vertices to add new relationships/weights, O(1) - insert new array element/linked list
4) O(1) - delete element in array, O(n) - would need to update all existing elements, O(1)
5) edge list - scan whole list, matrix - scan row, list - return array element with list
