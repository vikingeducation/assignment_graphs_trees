## Graph Data Questions

1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an Adjacency Matrix vs an Adjacency List relative to size and speed of common operations?
  
  Answer: An adjacency matrix is very fast for basic read operations but requires a lot of excess space. An adjacency list requires less space but compromises a bit on speed.

2. What would the Big O be of inserting a new EDGE to:

  - An Edge List? O(n) since it's essentially like adding an element to an array
  - An Adjacency Matrix? O(1) since the array already exists, and we are just updating one value
  - An Adjacency List? O(1) since it's adding a node to the end of a linked list

3. What would the Big O be of inserting a new VERTEX to:

  - An Edge List? O(n) since it's still adding an element to an array (assuming we are also adding an edge for that vertex)
  - An Adjacency Matrix? O(n^2) since we have to create a completely new 2-D array
  - An Adjacency List? O(n) since we are adding an element to the list array

4. What would the Big O be of REMOVING a vertex or edge from:

  - An Edge List? O(n) but potentially worse for removing a vertex because we would have to find all instances of that vertex and remove them
  - An Adjacency Matrix? For an edge, O(1), but for a vertex, O(n^2).
  - An Adjacency List? For a vertex, O(n), and for an edge, O(n) since we have to traverse the list to find the new "last"

5. How would you find all the nodes connected to a particular vertex and would would be its Big O for:

  - An Edge List? Select all pairs that contain that vertex, O(n)
  - An Adjacency Matrix? Select the row for that vertex, then get the indices for all non-nil values, O(n)
  - An Adjacency List? Select the index for that vertex, then crawl the linked list for all the edges, O(n)
