<li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an Adjacency Matrix vs an Adjacency List relative to size and speed of common operations?</li>
<li>What would the Big O be of inserting a new EDGE to:

<ol>
<li>An Edge List?</li>
<li>An Adjacency Matrix?</li>
<li>An Adjacency List?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What would the Big O be of inserting a new VERTEX to:

<ol>
<li>An Edge List?</li>
<li>An Adjacency Matrix?</li>
<li>An Adjacency List?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What would the Big O be of REMOVING a vertex or edge from:

<ol>
<li>An Edge List?</li>
<li>An Adjacency Matrix?</li>
<li>An Adjacency List?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How would you find all the nodes connected to a particular vertex in:

<ol>
<li>An Edge List?</li>
<li>An Adjacency Matrix?</li>
<li>An Adjacency List?</li>
</ol></li>
