1.What would the Big O be of inserting a new EDGE to:
    An Edge List?            O(1)
    An Adjacency Matrix?     O(1)
    An Adjacency List?       O(1)
2.What would the Big O be of inserting a new VERTEX to:
    An Edge List?            O(1)
    An Adjacency Matrix?     O(n)
    An Adjacency List?       O(1)
3.What would the Big O be of REMOVING a vertex or edge from:
    An Edge List?                     O(edges)    O(1) 
    An Adjacency Matrix?              O(vertice)  O(1)
    An Adjacency List?                O(1)        O(edges)
