1. Advantages of using an adjacency matrix consists of easy representation using an array, fast to locate an edge: O(1) disadvantages is wasted space.

advantages of an adjacency list reduces unwanted space, its fast to locate the list for each vertex, then to locate a particular edge just iterate through the list to the desired position.


2.What would the Big O be of inserting a new EDGE to:
An Edge List? O(1)
An Adjacency Matrix? O(1)
An Adjacency List? O(1)

3.What would the Big O be of inserting a new VERTEX to:
An Edge List? O(1)
An Adjacency Matrix? O(n*n)
An Adjacency List? O(1)

4.What would the Big O be of REMOVING a vertex or edge from:
An Edge List? O(1)
An Adjacency Matrix? O(n*n)
An Adjacency List? O(n)

5. How would you find all the nodes connected to a particular vertex in:
An Edge List?

An Adjacency Matrix?
iterate through the row and column 

An Adjacency List?
